                <div class="about">
                    <p>My name is Svetlana, I have a higher technical education. I graduated with a degree in management and information of technical systems.
                        I am purposeful and  result-oriented, so I graduated from school with a silver medal, and graduated from the University with excellence.
                        I started working at the University. My dream is work as a programmer. But when I changed my place of residence, I had to work as an economist.
                        Now I want to realize my dream.</p>

                    <p>My hobby is reading books. I like to read science fiction books. My favorite book is the Flower of  Life Drunvalo Melchizedek.
                        When I was younger, I used to read magazines of UFO.</p>

                    <p> My greatest weakness. Sometimes, when I try to solve the problem quickly I rush, so I can make mistakes. But I know this when I complete a task,
                        I pause, rest, and go back to my decision and look for mistakes. And if I find it, I'm correct them. </p>

                    <p>My greatest strength. I adjust to new situations fast. I get on well with colleagues. And most importantly,
                        I am a quick learner, self- developed, self-motivated</p>
